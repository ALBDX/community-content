# How to install IonCube Loader in CentOS 6
## Introduction
In this tutorial, I will explain how to install the IonCube Loader on CentOS6.
IonCube was founded in 2002, and introduced tools to protect software written in PHP from being
viewed, changed, and ran on unlicensed computers. The encoding technology was developed from earlier work on the PHP Accelerator project,
and included an online encoding service at the first start, where PHP scripts can be uploaded and an encoded version can be downloaded.
return and a command line program for Linux.

**Prerequisites**
- (virtual) server
- CentOS 6 installed

## Step 1 - Download IonCube
Download the required files into the /tmp directory on your system and extract them.

For CentOS on a 32bit system:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://downloads3.ioncube.com/loader_downloads/ioncube_loaders_lin_x86.tar.gz
tar xfz ioncube_loaders_lin_x86.tar.gz
```

For CentOS on a 64bit system:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget http://downloads3.ioncube.com/loader_downloads/ioncube_loaders_lin_x86-64.tar.gz
tar xfz ioncube_loaders_lin_x86-64.tar.gz
```

## Step 2 - Select the right IonCube Loader to install
To select the right IonCube loader to install, check your PHP version first. To display the PHP version, run `php -v`.  
Example Output:

```
PHP 5.6.4 (cli) (built: Jun 26 2012  21:17:27)
Copyright (c) 1997-2013 The PHP Group
Zend Engine v2.4.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2013 Zend Technologies with the ionCube PHP Loader (enabled) + Intrusion Protection from ioncube24.com (unconfigured) v5.0.18, Copyright (c) 2002-2015, by ionCube Ltd.
```

After that, locate the extension directory of the installed PHP version using the command from below:

`php -i | grep extension_dir`

Example Output:
```
extension_dir => /usr/lib/php5/20131226 => /usr/lib/php5/20131226
sqlite3.extension_dir => no value => no valut
```

Copy the IonCube Loader to the extension directory:

`cp /tmp/ioncube/ioncube_loader_lin_5.6.so  /usr/lib/php5/20131226/`

## Step 3 - Configure IonCube Loader
Open the configuration file and add the IonCube Loader

`vi /etc/php.ini`

`zend_extension = /usr/lib/php5/20131226/ioncube_loader_lin_5.6.so`

Restart your web server to apply the changes:

`systemctl restart httpd`

## Step 4 - Test the IonCube Loader

Check if the IonCube Loader is enabled with the command `php -m`.


## Conclusion
The IonCube Loader is now installed on your server.
Enjoy!
